IJulia_PLEAC
============

IJulia version of [PLEAC - Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook] (http://pleac.sourceforge.net/), created by Guillaume Cottenceau et al.
PLEAC examples were drawn, with the permission of the publisher, from the "Perl Cookbook" (by Tom Christiansen & Nathan Torkington, published by O'Reilly.
They provide a nice range of examples oriented toward data munging, 
the type of work I tend to want to do first when learning a new language.

####A Caution
I am new to Julia, and working through these examples as a learning exercise.  
The code in these workbooks likely does not represent best practice -- 
and your suggestions for improving the solutions are most welcome.


####Why isn't this project in the main PLEAC repo?

  This project uses the IJulia notebook, which appears to be incompatible with the PLEAC file format. 
  However I have contacted the PLEAC mailing list about moving these examples to the main repo.


#### View the notebooks using nbviewer:
The Julia examples below are principally translations from the [Python version](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_python).
The examples are not complete. Missing items are generally noted in comments.
