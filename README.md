IJulia_PLEAC
============

IJulia version of [PLEAC - Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook] (http://pleac.sourceforge.net/).
PLEAC examples are drawn from the "Perl Cookbook" (by Tom Christiansen & Nathan Torkington, published by O'Reilly.
They provide a nice range of examples oriented toward data munging, 
the type of work I tend to want to do first when learning a new language.

*WARNING:* I am new to Julia, and working through these examples as a learning exercise.  
The code in these workbooks likely does not represent best practice -- 
and your suggestions for improving the solutions are most welcome.

The main PLEAC site contains solutions in many languages, so why not add Julia solutions there?

Two reasons:  

1. The PLEAC project appears to have been dormant since early 2011.
2. I wanted to use the IJulia notebook, which is incompatible with the PLEAC file format.

The Julia examples below are principally translations from the [Python version](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_python)

The examples are not complete. Missing items are generally noted in comments.
